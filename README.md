# Solutions to Project Euler Problems in Rust

I wanted to learn Rust so I decided to work through some of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems and try and solve them using Rust. This project is my first attempt with the Rust language so there are almost certainly better or more idiomatic ways than my implementations. As it is my goal to gain familiarity with the Rust language and libraries I will use everything as my disposal rather than implementing features for myself e.g. BigInts, permutations etc.
